## Call for participation 2018 {#intro}
## Deadline April 15 {#deadline}

The yearly Libre Software Meeting (LSM) is an opportunity for beginners as well as veteran technicians to meet during several days to promote, discuss, develop, use and interrogate the Libre technologies, tools and culture.

This year, the LSM will stand, for the second time since its creation, at the University of Strasbourg from July 7 to 12, 2018.

The goal of this call is to incite you to contribute, and to describe the organization of the meeting. Further details regarding the location and the agenda will come later. If you need any special additional information, do not hesitate to contact us by email at contact [at] listes2018.rmll.info.

### Choices and topics for the 2018 edition {#edition2018}

For this year, the main topic will be **“Digital education: building captivity or new empowerment?”**. This topic will be running through the whole meeting. It is not exclusive, but we encourage you to submit proposals related to it. Questions about digital education relate to the major issues of teaching about and by these technologies. It covers teaching from primary school to university, but also learning within associations, self or continuous training and their social implications in general.

Beyond this main topic, we wish to underline the transversal and transdisciplinary aspects of the Free-culture movement, as it gathers free music, books, licenses and questions about privacy, governance and many other things. In fact, the Free-culture movement revolves around a humanist approach of culture: every person should be able to use, study, modify and share a ressource. We therefore encourage you to see beyond the purely technical aspects of software and computing.


### Themes {#themes}

<q>It would be one of the biggest missed opportunity of our time if free software would only lead to free code.</q> (Framasoft)  
Your contribution to the RMLL2018 should be related to one (or several) of the following themes. Of course, each of these themes are arbitrary and contains many sub-themes which are to be detailed once the agenda is wrapped up.

#### Initiation
contact: initiation [at] listes2018.rmll.info

It is essential that everyones feels free to take part in the Free movement in an accessible, stimulating, funny and sensitive way.  
We would like to encourage all kind of methods that aim to make use of the diversity of people's approaches, regardless of their age.  
The main focus for the **week-end of July, the 7th and 8th** will be intiation but it's also welcome during the rest of the week

Ex: a workshop “Learn music while programming” could gather live-coding software developers, teachers and children.

#### Tech
contact: technique [at] listes2018.rmll.info

The 2018 edition wouldn't be a LSM one without moments dedicated to tech. The Meetings strive to bring concrete motivation as well as exposure for the most recent technological developments. Software development, system administration, networking, electronics, fabrication are applicable to all domains (bureautics, health, domotics, graphics, social networks, etc...). We wish to welcome all kind of people, in the interest of the projects and communities involved. Thank you for evaluating the skill level required for your activity.

#### Society
contact: societe [at] listes2018.rmll.info

A group of human beings can be defined by what they share, and what is common to the group. By giving access to their creations, we redefined our communities around common resources. To think about how we deal with information is also to rethink the philosophy which underlies our legal, technical, and sociological tools: our way of dealing with technology.  
Can we control our institutions without a free access to their data? Can we do research without an access to the whole human knowledge?  
Can we master our own lives without having a control on our data, our social and professional platforms?  
Isn't our identity itself a piece of information?

#### Culture & Art
contact: arts [at] listes2018.rmll.info

The free culture includes all the elements resulting from those practices and esthetics which promote sharing and reappropriation as essential values; it concerns movies, video games, musics, theater, literature, etc. The LSM represents an opportunity to promote free licenses as full creation methods, and to question artistic practices, broadcasting modes, and the whole cultural economy.


### Location {#location}

The 2018 edition will stand at Strasbourg University, in the following buildings: l'Escarpe, l'Atrium and le Platane. Those three are close together, just separated by a dozen meters and an intermediate building.

+ l'Escarpe has 2 large lecture rooms (amphitheaters) with capacities of 521 and 221 persons; and one hall for the associative village;
+ l'Atrium has 2 large lecture rooms (amphitheaters) with capacities for 210 persons each; and one hall for the associative village;

You will then be able to send your intent to us until <mark>april 15, 12pm</mark>. We will ask you to define as precisely as possible what kind of public your proposal targets, what are the technical requirements (power, network access, radio or video broadcasting, fournitures). Also, before submitting a proposal yourself, please think about people from all under-represented gender/communities in such kind of events that you can find around you that may submit the same kind of reply as you and try to prioritize them.

Beyond the deadline, you'll be able to join the self-organized rooms which will be available during the festival. We will discuss the incomplete proposals as much as we can.  
Our availability being limited, a spontaneity and autonomy from you in this organisation will be more than great!
