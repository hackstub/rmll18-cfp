            <h2 id="intro">Call for participation 2018</h2>
            <h2 id="deadline">Deadline April 30</h2>
            <p id="form"><a href="https://rmll2018.info/cfp" target="_blank">Application form</a></p>
            <p>The yearly Libre Software Meeting (LSM) is an opportunity for beginners as well as veteran technicians to meet during several days to promote, discuss, develop, use and interrogate the Libre technologies, tools and culture.</p>
            <p>This year, the LSM will stand, for the second time since its creation, at the University of Strasbourg from July 7 to 12, 2018.</p>
            <p>The goal of this call is to incite you to contribute, and to describe the organization of the meeting. Further details regarding the location and the agenda will come later. If you need any special additional information, do not hesitate to contact us by email at contact [at] listes2018.rmll.info.</p>
            <h3 id="edition2018">Choices and topics for the 2018 edition</h3>
            <p>For this year, the main topic will be <strong>“Digital education: building captivity or new empowerment?”</strong>. This topic will be running through the whole meeting. It is not exclusive, but we encourage you to submit proposals related to it. Questions about digital education relate to the major issues of teaching about and by these technologies. It covers teaching from primary school to university, but also learning within associations, self or continuous training and their social implications in general.</p>
            <p>Beyond this main topic, we wish to underline the transversal and transdisciplinary aspects of the Free-culture movement, as it gathers free music, books, licenses and questions about privacy, governance and many other things. In fact, the Free-culture movement revolves around a humanist approach of culture: every person should be able to use, study, modify and share a ressource. We therefore encourage you to see beyond the purely technical aspects of software and computing.</p>
            <h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>
            <p><q>It would be one of the biggest missed opportunity of our time if free software would only lead to free code.</q> (Framasoft)<br />
            Your contribution to the RMLL2018 should be related to one (or several) of the following themes. Of course, each of these themes are arbitrary and contains many sub-themes which are to be detailed once the agenda is wrapped up.</p>
            <h4>Initiation</h4>
            <p>contact: initiation [at] listes2018.rmll.info</p>
            <p>It is essential that everyones feels free to take part in the Free movement in an accessible, stimulating, funny and sensitive way.<br />
            We would like to encourage all kind of methods that aim to make use of the diversity of people's approaches, regardless of their age.<br />
            The main focus for the <strong>week-end of July, the 7th and 8th</strong> will be intiation but it's also welcome during the rest of the week</p>
            <p>Ex: a workshop “Learn music while programming” could gather live-coding software developers, teachers and children.</p>
            <h4>Tech</h4>
            <p>contact: technique [at] listes2018.rmll.info</p>
            <p>The 2018 edition wouldn't be a LSM one without moments dedicated to tech. The Meetings strive to bring concrete motivation as well as exposure for the most recent technological developments. Software development, system administration, networking, electronics, fabrication are applicable to all domains (bureautics, health, domotics, graphics, social networks, etc...). We wish to welcome all kind of people, in the interest of the projects and communities involved. Thank you for evaluating the skill level required for your activity.</p>
            <h4>Society</h4>
            <p>contact: societe [at] listes2018.rmll.info</p>
            <p>A group of human beings can be defined by what they share, and what is common to the group. By giving access to their creations, we redefined our communities around common resources. To think about how we deal with information is also to rethink the philosophy which underlies our legal, technical, and sociological tools: our way of dealing with technology.<br />
            Can we control our institutions without a free access to their data? Can we do research without an access to the whole human knowledge?<br />
            Can we master our own lives without having a control on our data, our social and professional platforms?<br />
            Isn't our identity itself a piece of information?</p>
            <h4>Culture &amp; Art</h4>
            <p>contact: arts [at] listes2018.rmll.info</p>
            <p>The free culture includes all the elements resulting from those practices and esthetics which promote sharing and reappropriation as essential values; it concerns movies, video games, musics, theater, literature, etc. The LSM represents an opportunity to promote free licenses as full creation methods, and to question artistic practices, broadcasting modes, and the whole cultural economy.</p>
            <h3 id="location">Location</h3>
            <p>The 2018 edition will stand at Strasbourg University, in the following buildings: l'Escarpe, l'Atrium and le Platane. Those three are close together, just separated by a dozen meters and an intermediate building.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>l'Escarpe has 2 large lecture rooms (amphitheaters) with capacities of 521 and 221 persons; and one hall for the associative village;</li>
            <li>l'Atrium has 2 large lecture rooms (amphitheaters) with capacities for 210 persons each; and one hall for the associative village;</li>
            <li>le Platane has 20 rooms with a capacity of 50 persons each.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The gardens of the University campus will also be accessible during the festival, including a football field, and several smalll and larger lawns with walking paths, tables and benches.</p>
            <p>Besides the University Campus, events will take place in buildings located at a few hundred meters away: le Shadok and the Malraux Public Library, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, depending on the actual proposals.</p>
            <h3 id="orga">Daily organisation</h3>
            <h4>Tracks (themes)</h4>
            <p>The meeting will be organised around “tracks” (<em>fils rouges</em>), the main track being “Digital Education: factory for captivity or new empowerment?”. Each track corresponds to a succession of different types of events organized along the same theme.</p>
